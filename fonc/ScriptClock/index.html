                <p>Le <code>ScriptClock</code> est également très important dans la manipulation de l'exécution des scripts. C'est en quelque sorte le <em>chef d'orchestre</em> de l'exécution d'un script. Il permet d'arrêter, de reprendre ou de délayer la chaîne d'exécution des actions d'un bloc. En effet, un bloc d'action est parcouru de proche en proche, similairement au parcours d'un arbre avec une branche principale, pouvant momentanément (lors du passage dans les boucles) revenir sur lui même. Cette structure non récursive permet une efficacité accrue et une meilleure gestion de la mémoire lors de la lecture du script.</p>
<p>L'action <code>ActWait</code> est un bon exemple d'utilisation de l'objet <code>ScriptClock</code>.</p>
